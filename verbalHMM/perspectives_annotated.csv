0,beats,good morning everyone,
1,beats,I want to start,
2,beats,look at perspective,
3,beats,first will,
4,beats,at the kind of perspective,
5,beats,and then we'll,
6,beats,we'll look very quickly at,
7,beats,just in case you don't know what we're,
8,beats,perspective in art is,
9,metaphoric,represent three-dimensional objects,position of physical entities
10,metaphoric,on their two-dimensional canvas,position of physical entities
11,beats,there two basic source,
12,beats,aerial perspective and linear perspective aerial,
13,beats,aerial perspective,
14,deictic,perspective which,abstract entity
15,beats,ariel meaning,
16,metaphoric,air or atmospheric,abstract entity
17,metaphoric,atmospheric not,abstract entity
18,metaphoric,not your view from an airplane aerial,abstract entity
19,beats,is what the atmosphere affects,
20,deictic,a distant location,physical entity
21,beats,try to go into the laws of physics are,
22,beats,but it's aerial perspective that,
23,beats,be a different color that,
24,metaphoric,hazy or less (disctinct),description of physical entity
25,beats,that realistic artist,
26,beats,to reproduce and,
27,beats,that impression is used to create,
28,beats,think of the many of Turner's Landscapes,
29,beats,cityscapes,
30,deictic,cityscapes like Dido building in Carthage,physical entity
31,beats,just to get an idea of how,
32,beats,how the air can affect what,
33,beats,yellow perspective,
34,deictic,perspective linear perspective is,abstract entity
35,beats,is the way that things seem to get smaller,
36,beats,smaller farther away they,
37,beats,railroad tracks,
38,metaphoric,line of telephone pole running,motion
39,beats,get smaller and,
40,beats,till they vanish,
41,metaphoric,vanish to a point on the horizon,motion
42,metaphoric,called the vanishing point the,abstract entity
43,iconic,happens whenever parallel lines like,physical entity
44,iconic,like the 2 train tracks or,physical entity
45,iconic,or tops of telephone,physical entity
46,metaphoric,move in the same direction now,motion
47,beats,now cube,
48,beats,cube,
49,deictic,cube with,physical entity
50,beats,one of its faces,
51,beats,faces squarely perpendicular,
52,metaphoric,us has a single vanishing,abstract entity
53,deictic,it on the horizon but,physical entity
54,deictic,but a cube with a vertical Edge,physical entity
55,metaphoric,facing us has,position of physical entities
56,metaphoric,point one to the right one,position of physical entities
57,metaphoric,one to the left at,position of physical entities
58,beats,at least points are,
59,metaphoric,are left and right respectively,position of physical entities
60,metaphoric,respectively on the horizon,position of physical entities
61,metaphoric,lines of the phases,position of physical entities
62,metaphoric,(parallel line of the) phases converge,motion
63,deictic,there's also that same cube can be,physical entity
64,beats,a somewhat above,
65,metaphoric,above or below perspective,position of physical entities
66,deictic,have three Vanishing points,physical entity
67,metaphoric,one to the right one,position of physical entities
68,metaphoric,one to the left,position of physical entities
69,metaphoric,one behind it either,position of physical entities
70,metaphoric,below or,position of physical entities
71,metaphoric,or above the Horizon,position of physical entities
72,beats,the visual,
73,deictic,you look at a corner,attention direction
74,deictic,look down one street right,attention direction
75,deictic,point look down the cross street,attention direction
76,deictic,point if you look up,attention direction
77,beats,point these kinds of perspectives,
78,beats,perspectives are easy to see if we view,
79,beats,view geometric,
80,beats,man-made structures,
81,beats,really don't have any,
82,metaphoric,sets of parallel lines,physical entity
83,beats,that does not mean they,
84,beats,the laws of Optics,
85,beats,at all in early,
86,beats,artist recognize this affect,
87,metaphoric,but they weren't really able to,motion
88,deictic,paintings inside Egyptian Pyramids,physical entity
89,deictic,illustrations in medieval Christian,physical entity
90,beats,near people were,
91,beats,simply drawn larger,
92,iconic,larger or,size of physical entity
93,beats,lower in the picture on,
94,metaphoric,to cover up people that were farther (away),motion
95,beats,grasp of the idea,
96,beats,of learning,
97,beats,the Sciences,
98,beats,Sciences this was a hotbed of,
99,beats,DaVinci Galileo Newton,
100,beats,and Filippo Brunelleschi,
101,beats,15th,
102,beats,15th century Florentine architect,
103,beats,several Optical experiments,
104,beats,discovered the rules of perspective,
105,beats,enjoy a very accurate picture,
106,deictic,of San Giovanni,person
107,metaphoric,and then he made a small peep hole in,motion
108,beats,his acquaintances,
109,metaphoric,having them look through that peep hole,motion
110,beats,first at a mirror which,
111,metaphoric,which reflected the image,motion
112,beats,sight then Brunelleschi,
113,beats,Brunelleschi would,
114,metaphoric,would quickly withdraw the,motion
115,deictic,leaving the viewer peeping,person
116,metaphoric,peeping at the actual baptistery whose perspective has,motion
117,metaphoric,has been replicated perfectly other,motion
118,beats,artist notably Donatello began,
119,beats,ideas soon spread,
120,beats,was really developed by,
121,beats,of the same. Be,
122,beats,in the works of John Van,
123,beats,of Chancellor rolin but,
124,beats,but that's a whole other story,
