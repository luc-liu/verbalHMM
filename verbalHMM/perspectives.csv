0,beats,good morning everyone,
1,beats,I want to start,
2,beats,look at perspective,
3,beats,first will,
4,beats,at the kind of perspective,
5,beats,and then we'll,
6,beats,we'll look very quickly at,
7,beats,just in case you don't know what we're,
8,beats,perspective in art is,
9,metaphoric,represent three-dimensional objects,
10,metaphoric,on their two-dimensional canvas,
11,beats,there two basic source,
12,beats,aerial perspective and linear perspective aerial,
13,beats,aerial perspective,
14,deictic,perspective which,
15,beats,Ariel meaning,
16,metaphoric,error atmospheric,
17,metaphoric,atmospheric not,
18,metaphoric,not your view from an airplane aerial,
19,beats,is what the atmosphere affects,
20,deictic,a distant location,
21,beats,try to go into the laws of physics are,
22,beats,but it's aerial perspective that,
23,beats,be a different color that,
24,metaphoric,hazy or less,
25,beats,that realistic artist,
26,beats,to reproduce and,
27,beats,that impression is used to create,
28,beats,think of the many of Turner's Landscapes,
29,beats,cityscapes,
30,deictic,cityscapes like Dido building in Carthage,
31,beats,just to get an idea of how,
32,beats,how the air can affect what,
33,beats,yellow perspective,
34,deictic,perspective linear perspective is,
35,beats,is the way that things seem to get smaller,
36,beats,smaller farther away they,
37,beats,railroad tracks,
38,metaphoric,line of telephone pole running,
39,beats,get smaller and,
40,beats,till they vanish,
41,metaphoric,vanish to a point on the horizon,
42,metaphoric,called the vanishing point the,
43,iconic,happens whenever parallel lines like,
44,iconic,like the 2 train tracks or,
45,iconic,or tops of telephone,
46,metaphoric,move in the same direction now,
47,beats,now cube,
48,beats,cube,
49,deictic,cube with,
50,beats,one of its faces,
51,beats,faces squarely perpendicular,
52,metaphoric,us has a single vanishing,
53,deictic,it on the horizon but,
54,deictic,but a cube with a vertical Edge,
55,metaphoric,facing us has,
56,metaphoric,point one to the right one,
57,metaphoric,one to the left at,
58,beats,at least points are,
59,metaphoric,are left and right respectively,
60,metaphoric,respectively on the horizon,
61,metaphoric,lines of the phases,
62,metaphoric,phases converge,
63,deictic,converge there's also that same Q can be,
64,beats,a somewhat above,
65,metaphoric,above or below perspective,
66,deictic,have three Vanishing points,
67,metaphoric,one to the right one,
68,metaphoric,one to the left,
69,metaphoric,one behind it either,
70,metaphoric,below or,
71,metaphoric,or above the Horizon,
72,beats,the visual,
73,deictic,you look at a corner,
74,deictic,look down one street right,
75,deictic,point look down the cross street,
76,deictic,point if you look up,
77,beats,point these kinds of perspectives,
78,beats,perspectives are easy to see if we view,
79,beats,view geometric,
80,beats,man-made structures,
81,beats,really don't have any,
82,metaphoric,sets of parallel lines,
83,beats,that does not mean they,
84,beats,the laws of Optics,
85,beats,at all in early,
86,beats,artist recognize this affect,
87,metaphoric,but they weren't really able to,
88,deictic,paintings inside Egyptian Pyramids,
89,deictic,illustrations in medieval Christian,
90,beats,near people were,
91,beats,simply drawn larger,
92,iconic,larger or,
93,beats,lower in the picture on,
94,metaphoric,the cover of people that were father,
95,beats,grasp of the idea,
96,beats,of learning,
97,beats,the Sciences,
98,beats,Sciences this was a hotbed of,
99,beats,DaVinci Galileo Newton,
100,beats,and Filippo Brunelleschi,
101,beats,15th,
102,beats,15th century Florentine architect,
103,beats,several Optical experiments,
104,beats,discovered the rules of perspective,
105,beats,enjoy a very accurate picture,
106,deictic,of San Giovanni,
107,metaphoric,and then he made a small people in,
108,beats,his acquaintances,
109,metaphoric,having them look through that people,
110,beats,first at a mirror which,
111,metaphoric,which reflected the image,
112,beats,sight then Brunelleschi,
113,beats,Brunelleschi would,
114,metaphoric,would quickly withdraw the,
115,deictic,leaving the viewer peeping,
116,metaphoric,peeping at the actual baptistery whose perspective I've,
117,metaphoric,I've been replicated perfectly other,
118,beats,artist notably Donatello began,
119,beats,ideas soon spread,
120,beats,was really developed by,
121,beats,of the same. Be,
122,beats,in the works of John Van,
123,beats,of Chancellor rolin but,
124,beats,but that's a whole other story,
