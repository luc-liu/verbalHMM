Transcript:  okay now from Britain tarmac spread to United States but American preferred asphalt which is a substance that occurs naturally lakes and rocks as well as synthetic Lee as a byproduct of petroleum production asphalt is more resilient than car and hold up better in a wider range of temperatures its first recorded use dates back to about 3000 BC when the Sumerians used it to preserve mommy's waterproof ships and cement brick hot mix asphalt or HMA is a combination of Aggregates like sand gravel crushed stone minerals and an asphalt binder like coal tar was first used in the US for crosswalks and sidewalks in the late 1860's the first road was paved with HMA in 1870 in New Jersey
