Transcript: good morning everyone today I want to start with a look at perspective visual perspective first will look briefly at the kind of perspective and then we'll look very quickly at its history and are just in case you don't know what we're discussing perspective in art is the way that artist represent three-dimensional objects on their two-dimensional canvas there two basic source of perspective aerial perspective and linear perspective aerial perspective

Transcript:  which is Ariel meaning error atmospheric not your view from an airplane aerial perspective is what the atmosphere affects we see especially a distant location I don't want to try to go into the laws of physics are involved here but it's aerial perspective that makes a mountain in the distance appear to be a different color that makes it seem hazy or less distinct than closer objects these are effects that realistic artist really attempt to reproduce and that impression is used to create their own effects just think of the many of Turner's Landscapes or cityscapes like Dido building in Carthage just to get an idea of how the air can affect what we see

Transcript:  yellow perspective linear perspective is the way that things seem to get smaller farther away they get classic example of this is the way we perceive railroad tracks or line of telephone pole running away from us they seem to get smaller and smaller as they recede till they vanish to a point on the horizon and this point is appropriately called the vanishing point the effect happens whenever parallel lines like the 2 train tracks or tops of telephone poles move in the same direction now cube with one of its faces squarely perpendicular to us has a single vanishing point directly behind it on the horizon but a cube with a vertical Edge facing us has two vanishing point one to the right one to the left at least points are left and right respectively on the horizon for the parallel lines of the phases converge

Transcript:  these kinds of perspectives are easy to see if we view geometric shapes or man-made structures but of course natural scenes really don't have any sets of parallel lines they have no vanishing point but that does not mean they don't exhibit perspective the laws of Optics we're not understood at all in early Western Art artist recognize this affect course but they weren't really able to figure it out for accurately from the paintings inside Egyptian Pyramids to illustrations in medieval Christian churches near people were simply drawn larger or drawn lower in the picture on the cover of people that were father away there was no real understanding of how the physics of perception worked and never got a grasp of the idea of the vanishing point
