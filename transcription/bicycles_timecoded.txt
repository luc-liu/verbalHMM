Transcript: bicycles we don't know with certainty who invented the bicycle or where was invented or even when we do know that the modern bicycle has several precursors from different parts of Europe that many of its individual components will develop separately at different periods of time some historians claim that the famous artist Leonardo da Vinci is the true father of the bicycle in 1492 Vinci sketch the remarkable facsimile of a modern bicycle but his idea was never implemented ironically DaVinci also sketched a modern helicopter hundreds of years before it was invented

Transcript: anyway about 300 years later a French inventor build something similar to a bicycle color running machine this contraption was made of wood that two wheels connected by a beam but no paddles or a steering mechanism Riders propelled the Machine by straddling the beam and pushing with their feet along the ground like a scooter you can imagine that steering and stopping we're not so easy in those times in 1817 a German named Karl Von drais improve the writing machine by adding a front wheel and that this could be easily steered he called this a drazien but because that word was hard to pronounce it became poppoly known as a hobby horse which was the name of a popular children's toy at the time hobby horses were popular fad for a while however they were still really hard to Pedal feel hard to move along the unpaved roads of the day

Transcript: many credit Kirkpatrick MacMillan with the invention of the first modern bicycle in 1839 McMillan a Scottish blacksmith made a real wheel driven machine that people say I could reach high speeds be high speed relative of course the French however took exception to McMillan's claim to this day they call Pierre Michelle the father of the bicycle because Michelle and his son Ernest at a pedals and cranks in the mid 1860s they call their innovation of a loss of pet which means fast foot and it's Park a bicycle craze all through Europe in the US just like hobby horses though the popularity of the loss of pets was short-lived turns out in a lot of pain with heavy clumsy to mouth and spear despite their nickname they were all so slow
